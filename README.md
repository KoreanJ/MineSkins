# MineSkins

In this project I aim to explore the vast landscape of publicy available Minecraft skins in order to understand the features that describe each skin's "class". Using this information and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), I create brand new Minecraft skins from particular "classes" using only public Minecraft skins as my training data.
